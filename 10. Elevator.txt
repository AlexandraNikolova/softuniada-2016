An elevator has capacity of W kg and P persons. You are given a sequence of N persons with weights w1, ..., wn to be lifted by the elevator. Group the people in minimal number of groups G so that each group has <= P members and total weight <= W. Print the number G.

Input:
  W = 100
  P = 4
  People = 1 40 90 70 5 29 58 3
Output:
  3 groups
  40 + 58
  70 + 29
  90 + 5 + 3 + 1

Solution: dynamic programming + greedy.

While possible, find the "optimal" group and remove it. The optimal group is a subset of elements, such that their total weight is maximal, but <= W and their count <= P.
