Stars in the Cube (Coding with 3-Dimentional Array)
---------------------------------------------------

We are given a cube of Latin letters of size n * n * n given as n matrices of size n * n.

Write a program to calculate how many 3D stars of 7 cells (center, up, down, left, right,
front, back) holding equal letters exist in the cube.

Input:

5
a a a a a | a p a a a | a a a a a | a p a a a | p p p p p
a p a a a | p p p a a | a p a a a | p p p a a | p p p p p
a a a a a | a p x x a | a p a a a | p p p a a | p p p p p
a a x x a | a x x x x | a a x x a | a p a a a | p p p p p
a a a a a | a a x x a | a a a a a | a a a a a | p p p p p

Output:

6
a -> 1
p -> 3
x -> 2
