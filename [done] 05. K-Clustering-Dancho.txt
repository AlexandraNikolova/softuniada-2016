K-Clustering Greedy Algorithm
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/pdf/04GreedyAlgorithmsII-2x2.pdf

Divide objects into k non-empty groups.

Given an integer k, find a k-clustering of maximum spacing (the min between any pair of points in different clusters).

Type: Greedy, similar to Kruskal's algorithm
Level: 5/10
