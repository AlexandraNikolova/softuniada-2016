Stars in the Cube (Coding with 3-Dimentional Array)
---------------------------------------------------

We are given a cube of Latin letters of size n * n * n given as n matrices of size n * n.

Write a program to calculate how many 3D stars of 7 cells (center, up, down, left, right,
front, back) holding equal letters exist in the cube.

Input:

a a a a a | a p a a a | a a a a a | a p a a a | a a a a a
a p a a a | p p p a a | a p a a a | p p p a a | a p a a a
a a a a a | a p c c a | a a a a a | a p a a a | a a a a a
a a c c a | a c c c c | a a c c a | a a a a a | a a a a a
a a a a a | a a c c a | a a a a a | a a a a a | a a a a a

Output:

a -> 1
c -> 2
p -> 2
