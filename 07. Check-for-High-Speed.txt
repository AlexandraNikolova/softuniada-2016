Graphs: Cameras are on the road. They collect info for each driver:

------------------------
cam7	12:50	CA4460TH
cam12	12:55	CA4460TH
cam2	13:03	BT8850HM
cam2	13:04	CA4460TH
...

If the average speed is greater than some threshold (e.g. 90 km/h), we consider the car is speeding.

We have the graph and can calculate the distances between the cameras (Floyd-Warshal algorithm).

We have the speed limits for each edge.

Find all drivers that run out of speed.
